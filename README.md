# Movie API

Create a server-side REST API for an application called “myFlix” that interacts with a database that stores data about different movies. 

The web application will provide users with access to information about different movies, directors, and genres. 

Users will be able to sign up, update their personal information, and create a list of their favorite movies.

This is the complete server-side of the web application including the server, business logic, and business layers of the application. It consists of a REST API and database built using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It will be accessed via commonly used HTTP methods like GET and POST.

Whenever users of myFlix are interacting with the application, the server-side of the application will be in use, processing their requests and performing operations against the data in the database. These users will be able to use the myFlix application whenever they like to read information about different movies or update their user information, for instance, their list of “Favorite Movies.”

Movie enthusiasts want to be able to access information about different movies, directors, and genres. The server-side of the myFlix application will ensure they have access to this information, that their requests can be processed, and that all necessary data can be stored.
